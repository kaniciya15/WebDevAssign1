                <h2>Interaction with humans</h2>

                    Even though they look so sweet and nice we shouldn't pet, feed or even swim with them,since they are wild animals you can't predict their actions.

                   Always we should ensure a positive environment around the animal and start with baby steps and by giving them the reward(food) for every correct task they complete.
                   By using voice signal, hand signal and the whistle we can guide the animal correctly.Using all these way the trainers are able to train the sea lions for the show that we all enjoy.
